		<h2> Into the Mountains </h2>
			<p> Back in October 2017, I went to one of my adventurous trip to Manang and Tilicho Lake - lake situated at elevation of 16,000 ft. </p>

			<h3> Day 1 </h3>	
			<p>
			We were group of 6 people with three motorcycles travelling towards north western part of the Nepal.
			We started our trip at 6 am in the morning as we have set a target of reaching Chame, Manang which include 40 miles of mountain road. 
			We were moving according to the plan and reached Besisahar, Lamjung with no delay. Then came the long mountainous road with lots of waterfalls, streams and rocky roads. 
			Because of difficult terrain, we had to stop multiple times, fix our bikes and also our back ( road was very tough). finally after 5 hours of bumpin g road, we reached Chame.  
			
			</p>
			<h3> Day 2 </h3>
			<h4> Chame to Khansar </h4>
